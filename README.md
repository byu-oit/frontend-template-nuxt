# Frontend Nuxt Project Template

> For the BYU Apps Custom Code team.

## What this contains

This template includes the initial setup and scaffolding you need to create a frontend application in our custom stack. It includes the following:

- [BYU Browser OAuth Implicit](https://github.com/byuweb/byu-browser-oauth-implicit) package preconfigured. There is also a custom Nuxt plugin that adds the bearer token to `$axios` for use throughout your project.
- Graceful error handling including network errors and authentication errors. A `v-dialog` is created presenting the error to the user.
- Vuetify customized with BYU brand compliant colors.
- The BYU theme components
- BYU fronts (Ringside and Public Sans).
- Skeleton/Example pages converted to TypeScript.
- Tests for functionality already included in the template.
- A functioning Vuex store.
- Type definitions for the initial project.
- Proper linting and code style setup.
- CI/CD files (for Handel, Handel CodePipeline, and CodeBuild).
- Browser support.
